See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information.

From the schematic row1 is gpio pin 13 and col9 is gpio pin 12

To light an led you need the row high and the column low, so we could
make row1 high and make col9 go high/low or make col9 low and make
row1 go high/low, so that is what this does.

Blinks an led somewhere in the middle of the array.
