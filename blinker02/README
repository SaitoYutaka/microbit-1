See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information.

Like blinker01 this blinks an led.  But this uses TIMER0.  Was not
obvious how this design works, but I can see the other perpherals
work in a similar way.   It appears that we are using a 16MHz clock.

There is perhaps an internal 16Mhz oscillator and an external one
on the schematic.

"When the system enters ON mode, HFCLK RC oscillator will start up
automatically to provide the required clocks for the system."

So lets assume that we are using the (internall) RC oscillator at this
point.
