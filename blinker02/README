See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information.

Like blinker01 this blinks an led.  But this uses TIMER0.  Was not
obvious how this design works, but I can see the other perpherals
work in a similar way.   It appears that we are using a 16MHz clock.

I am thinking that this chip requires an oscillator and from the
schematic that is a 16Mhz oscillator.  So this is making sense so far.
