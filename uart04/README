Okay, not ideal, normally want to send the character, go do other
stuff, then before sending another check for txready/empty.  We can
do that if we prime the pump.  So instead send the character then
wait for it to go out.  We dont get the parallelism, but at least
for a bit now it has not slipped a character at 115200.  Will see how
it goes.
