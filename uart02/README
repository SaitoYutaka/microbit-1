See the previous level README for schematic and programmers reference
information.

Took a little figuring out.  It doesnt assert txready until you have
actually sent something, but you can clear txread by writing to it
(and need to).  So if I want to do stuff while sending, I have to prime
it by shooting out a character).

Otherwise to poll it you write to txd, wait for txready then clear
tx ready.
